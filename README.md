# Fish Freshness Detection using Fish Eye Images

This project predicts the freshness of fish based on fish-eye images using machine learning. It leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify fish images into fresh or not fresh categories.

---

## 🐟 Features

- **Image-Based Detection**: Uses fish-eye images to determine freshness.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Built using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Flask Web Application**: User-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing results.
- **Accuracy**: Optimized model for accurate freshness prediction.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **Keras**: High-level API for TensorFlow.
- **Flask**: For creating the web application.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pillow**: For image processing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For data preprocessing and evaluation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/fish-freshness-detection.git
   cd fish-freshness-detection
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure the model file (`model.h5`) is in the correct directory:
   ```
   C:\Users\Munazil\Documents\project\fisheye\web_app\model.h5
   ```

---

## ⚡ Usage

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

2. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

4. Upload a fish-eye image and view the freshness prediction.
